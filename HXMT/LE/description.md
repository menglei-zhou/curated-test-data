Insight-HXMT/LE Observations of the Black Hole Binary Cyg X-1 in the Hard State (PhoIndex = 1.7)

Cyg X-1 is a persistent X-ray source exhibiting spectral variability. Its continuum can be characterized by Comptonization with a high-energy cutoff, modulated by absorption from the interstellar medium.

We recommend focusing on the energy range of 2--10 keV.
